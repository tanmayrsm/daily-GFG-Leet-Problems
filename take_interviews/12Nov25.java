Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

n = 10^5


Largest subarray with 0 sum

Given an array arr[] containing both positive and negative integers, the task is to find the length of the longest subarray with a sum equals to 0.

Note: A subarray is a contiguous part of an array, formed by selecting one or more consecutive elements while maintaining their original order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subarray with sum equals to 0 is [-2, 2, -8, 1, 7].
Input: arr[] = [2, 10, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray with a sum of 0.
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, -4, 3, 1, 0]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subarray with sum equals to 0 is [0, -4, 3, 1, 0]
Constraints:
        1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
        −103 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103

Top K frequent elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2

Output: [1,2]



Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 105
        -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
