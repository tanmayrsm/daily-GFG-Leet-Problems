You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.



Example 1:

Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
Example 2:

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]


Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible permutations in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output:
        [[1,1,2],
        [1,2,1],
        [2,1,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 8
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water the container can contain is 49 from [8...7].

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1


Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
