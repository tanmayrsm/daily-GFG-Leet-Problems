Walk me through your most impactful frontend platform project and your role in it. What were the main technical challenges and outcomes?

- react 18 upgrade
- FPTI
- triggering pagerduty insightly alerts
- bizcomponents clean up
- module federation

TCS -
- caching serviceworker at client side for alrayd visited urls (cached fisrt, network first, stale while revalidate)
- experience designer with JSON -> include for real time, we used config based design -> Etag -> header -> said if whole json was same or not


Tell me about a time you influenced frontend architecture across multiple teams. What resistance did you face, and how did you handle it?
- (small) -> using type strict for templating files in angular, to get ide level alert for syntax errors
- automated script to convert current experience jsons to new versions
- module federation UIs
- migrating to playwright
    - codegen -> automatically wirte FTs
    - multi browser support (cypress - only chromium)
    - parallel run CI (tests run parallely)
    - mock APIs at network tab level



CRISIL use case
